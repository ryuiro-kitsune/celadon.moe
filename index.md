The *official* site for <a rel="me" href="https://solarpunk.moe/@celadonCamellia">Celadon Camellia</a> (an alias obviously) who is currently residing in Solarpunk (dot) moe.

I am interested in FOSS technology, writing, BusyBox/Linux[^1], and Coffee. But don't expect any coherent theming, I am much too chaotic for that.
