Sup. Here's what's been happening in the world of me.

I am fully in college again, which is delightful. I'm planning on uploading the work I do for my creative writing classes here, so expect a smattering of poems and maybe a novella. Also in a lit analysis and modern south Asia class, but I dunno if I can milk them for that sweet sweet blog nectar.

I'm thinking about taking a crowbar to the separation between this site and my "self." So, if I do that I'll post some dorm-room pics.

P.S. Supdates are totally becoming a series. It's too late, you can't escape the lame word-play...
