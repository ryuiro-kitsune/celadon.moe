I'm a firm believer in the philosophy that style should be separated from substance. Ever since I knew what the word "markdown" meant, I have been writing everything in markup languages to later transform into finished projects, school papers, or even theatre programs. Of course, the exact method I've done this has changed a lot over the years, but the constant has always been one thing &mdash; WYSINWYG[^1].
