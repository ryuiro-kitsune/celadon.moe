Gemini is a reaction to the corpratization and commodification of the web. It is just another protocol in the long line of internet protocols --- spanning from NNTP, gopher, ftp, http, and beyond --- but, much like gopher before it, I've usually seen it billed as a "web replacement."

Is this true? Is Gemini what will save us from being a corprate hellscape home to Facebook, YouTube, and Google? Is it even good?

Let's find out.

# What is Gemini?

Gemini is a protocol that allows arbitrary transfer of data and files. The main purpose of the protocol is to transfer HyperText documents that have a specific markup language that allows clients to display the documents. If that sounds like the World Wide Web, yeah, we'll get to that. Gemini is designed as an evolution of the gopher protocal, but is built with modern technologies like TLS from the get-go. It has a simple markup language that resembles Markdown more than it does HTML.

Time to bring back in the elephant. Yes, Gemini feels like a stripped down version of the Web. This is largly on purpose, with Gemini being presented as a halfway point between gopher and the Web --- being able to coexist with both. But before I go off on my thoughts about the concessions and choices made, I should clear up something.

## What the heck is the World Wide Web, and why am I comparing Gemini to it?

A lot of us don't really know what the Web is. Let's fix that.
