The car ride was quiet. Dirk had both the wheel of his dingy Honda Civic and the aux, causing the only sound to be the faint pop music coming from the speakers.

Dirk glanced up

"So bro, you ready for your new life of freedom?"

Dave stared out of the car window at the endless fields of nothing and farmland.

"Bro? You alive over there."

Dave continued staring.

"It's just us now, we gotta be able to talk, Dave."

"Why did you choose Iowa?" His voice was quieter than it was in public, "I've been thinking about it for the past three hours, but I don't know the reason that of all the schools in Texas, of all the schools in the _country_, why'd you pick a school in the fucking second largest city in Iowa?"

Dirk adjusted the center mirror to look at the car behind them, "Why are you thinking about this now and not when I applied two years ago?"

Dave sat in silence, "Because I'm following you now, and John is following me. Your descion matters, it didn't then. It just was one more impulsive descion you'd made in a long line of impulsive decisions."

"Dude, where's this coming from? You should have said something when you were applying if you thought it was a shit idea."

"Fuck off, I didn't know John was going to apply to the same college as me! He didn't even ask why I was applying!"

"Well, I would fucking _hope_ that you care about your school as much as you care about John's!"

The car descended into a silence broken up by the faint blare of the radio. A mile flew by and Dirk knew he should say something.

It took another mile for him to figure out what.

"I applied because Roxy's mom works here. She was my only friend by the end of school so I wanted to be with her."

Dave mulled over his brother's words.

"...is it a good school."

"I would have told you to go somewhere else if it wasn't at least okay."

The car was silent for a long while after that.

Rose wasn't sleeping, not that she ever slept really. A more accurate statement would be that she merely passed out every 18 odd hours.

In place of sleep on this specific night, she was shooting off messages to her friends across the United States in younger time-zones, filling the time between their replies with putting digital scrawls into her netbook's meager storage space.

She was excited to follow in her sister and mother's footsteps, if not in revolutionizing the scientific disciplines as they aspired to, then by writing a story that would render even the most wretched humans blubbering wrecks of emotion at the sheer brilliance of the story.

Naturally, she would be enrolling in their school's creative writing program. She would have preferred something farther from home, but going to the school that the two of them already were at would save her the obligation of returning home, leaving her free to pursue excellence.

She also couldn't wait for the look on Dave's face when he realized the secret she'd been keeping from him.

This was going to be fun.

{{ hr() }}

Dave's phone vibrated in his pocket about 40 miles outside the city limits. He took it out and replied to Rose.

<div class="chat">
<span class="rose">TT: how close are you to your school</span><br />

Dave sighed and put his phone to sleep.

Dirk glanced over at him, "Who ya talkin to, bro?"

"Rose," Dave replied, "she's a...friend."

"Well, that seems convincing," Dirk said with a voice saturated with sarcasm, "she your secret girlfriend, or something?"

Dave burst out laughing, "Jesus friggin Christ no! She and I have a purely platonic relationship based on ironic flirting and fucking with the other."

"Sounds like a girlfriend," Dirk said while adjusting the GPS.

Dave snorted, "Yeah, like you'd know. The year you graduated you were the head of the GSA and organized a Pride Parade."

"I coulda been bi."

"Are you?"

"Not telling. You wanna stop at wendy's before we get there?"

"Why wendy's?"

Dirk chuckled, "There's one a block from the school, so whenever I'd miss dinner for whatever reason, I'd walk through the drive through and order food."

"You are...something else."

"Is that a yes."

"Eh, fuckit. Why not?"

"Hell yeah!"

Dave felt another buzz and quickly replied to the final Rose text of the day.

<div class="chat">
<span class="rose">TT: i need your dorm address</span><br />
<span class="rose">TT: so i can send you mail</span><br />
<span class="dave">TG: yeah sure, whatever</span><br />
<span class="dave">TG: post 304</span>

The elevator was silent as Rose ascended.

Rose had poleitly declined her sister's offer to "help her move in," as she had been on campus enough times that she could manage by herself, thank you very much. Besides its not like she had more than a small bag to move in with.

The elevator dinged and the doors opened to the ninth floor of Murray hall. Rose strolled forward to take a peek through the window.

The sight was breathtaking and filled her with feelings of power and bliss. The fact that she could just make out dave's dorm building from the corner of her vision contributed to that feeling.

As she stepped back from the window she absently opened her phone to double check her dorm room number one last time.

903, just like the last four times.

Rose stopped in front of room 903 and delivered a swift and determined rap onto the door.

The door cracked open a tiny bit.

"何これ…" A voice groaned from beheind the door.

Rose cleared her throat, "My name is Rose Lalonde. I'm going to be your roommate this year. Pleased to make your aquantince."

"Fuck," The voice said, "come in."

The door opened slowly and Rose got her first look at her new roomate.

She seemed to be hungover or, at minimum, was not used to getting up before noon. She was wearing a dark red lipstick and eyeshadow that appeared, from the smearing, to have been applied the previous night. Her eyes, which she was rubbing currently, were reddish brown and her skin was only a shade or two darker than her own. Her hair was black and&amp;#x2014;

Rose felt her face grow warm.

She wasn't wearing a top or bra. The only thing covering her...Rose's neck twitched...ample bust was her long hair.

"I, um, hello...You, forgot," she stuttered while gesturing with all the tact of a wilderbeast.

"Hm?" The girl murmered, "Oh. Yeah."

Having realized the issue, she swiped a T-Shirt from on top of her bed and put it on. Inadvertantly flashing Rose even more as she did.

"Yo," the girl said, "I'm Damara. I have a splitting headache, so if you can dump your stuff and leave..."

"Um, yes, that's...fine."

"Aight, see you tonight or whatever."

Rose carefully set her bag on her bed and left the room significantly less resolute than she entered it.

A small family of three---a smartly dressed single father and his twin children---sat in the Spokane International Airport’s A concourse while eating sandwhiches.

"Now boarding flight 413620 to Denver Colorado. Repeat, now boarding flight 413620 to Denver Colorado."

The father stood up and clapped his hands together, "Alright gang! Ready to head off into a new tommorow?"

The twins, John and Jade, rolled their eyes in sync.

"Now, now," he continued, "this is an excedingly important time in a young man and woman’s life."

"Dad," John said, "that’s what you tell us when we’re checking into our dorms..."

"Not when we’re boarding the plane to the layover," Jade finished.

"Pish posh! Every step on your journey matters!"

The twins smiled to themselves, gathered their bags, and followed their dad into his new tommorow.

At the tender hour of 3:30 AM, Terezi had her laptop and an internet chess program.

</div>

Terezi started the match and the two settled down into the same rhythm that they always did during these games.

Well, they'd only been playing each other since they first met, nearly 5 months ago when their families booked the same time slot for a school tour. The two had hit it off and exchanged contact information.

Somehow they managed it without learning each others names.

Dave unlocked the door of his dorm room and moved his bags into the room.

He seemed to be the last person on the floor to move into his dorm. He knew it couldn't be true&amp;#x2014;uperclassmen moved in the day after&amp;#x2014;but no one else akwardly had their bags in the hall as they struggled with the deadbolts and that fact alone felt isolating.

"Fuck."

John still wasn't here.

The last Dave heard from him, he had just landed in the Eastern Iowa Airport and was taking the Uber to the school. Dave threw a punch into the air. _I am not ready for this._

Sure, he had been looking forward to meeting John for years at this point, but...

Dave began pacing.

_Fuck._

Despite Dirk's reassurences, he still wasn't sure John going to this school was a good idea.

_I should have pushed back harder..._

Dave sat down on rightmost the bed and let himself fall onto his back.

He stared at the ceiling and felt the minutes drift by.

Then, he heard a knock on his door.

It was time.

{{ hr() }}

John Egbert stood on the other side of the door holding a single suitcase.

Dave slowly unlatched the door and pulled it open towards himself. John had a massive smile on his face.

He said something but Dave couldn't hear through the rush of blood in his head.

Dave stumbled forward and wordlessly hugged John, squeezing him tight to reassure himself that he wouldn't leave.

John nestled under Dave's chin and Dave could feel him say something else from the vibration.

The two broke the hug and John brought his bag into their new home for the next year.

{{ hr() }}

The other side of the door stood a short haired girl wearing a grey sweater, a pleated skirt, and cherry red makeup.

"Who are you?"

The girl smiled, "Why, my dear David, you don’t recognize me? I would have thought after 8 years you’d know your friends, be they online or real life."

Dave stared at her.

She sighed, "My name is Rose Lalonde. We have been online friends since we were in elementary school."

"Yeah," Dave said while scratching the back of his head, "I kinda don’t buy that. At most Rose told you to prank me."

"I..." Rose said, "Why don’t you believe me! I’m Rose! Your friend!"

"Listen Ma’am," Dave said, "you don’t look like Rose. Rose has long hair and dresses like a reject from Hot Topic. In addition to that, the likelyhood of Rose going this far for a joke is dumb. So you’re not her."

The two stared at each other for a moment before Rose broke down and burst out laughing.

"Hahaha, I...I can’t believe it. My schemes cancelled themselves out."

She grabbed her wallet from a skirt pocket and fished out her State ID. Rose Lalonde, Iowa.

"I am Rose Lalonde."

Dave blinked at her, "Then why do you look like...un-gothy."

"I thought it would be humourous if I changed up my appearence to shock you. Well, that and the fact that I’ve changed my outlook on life since freshman year of highschool."

"Okay, sure. Makes sense and all that shit, but why are you here? Like, surely you wouldn’t follow me to this school as a joke. I know you have aspirations and shit."

She sighed, "It was honestly a coincidence. My mother and and sister were already here, so I followed them."

"So, the same reason I’m here." He said. "Whoo legacy hire," he added flatly.

"Indeed."

Dave sighed, "Hi Rose."

"Hello Dave."

"I ruined your joke, didn’t I?"

Rose smiled, "Perhaps, but the bulk of the joke was the slow realization that you’ll have to deal with me for four years."

"Yeah, assuming we don’t drive each other crazy."

"Or anyone else for that manner."

They smiled at each other for a moment before Dave started again, "Come on, lemme introduce you to John."
