At the tender hour of 3:30 AM, Terezi had her laptop and an internet chess program.

Terezi started the match and the two settled down into the same rhythm that they always did during these games.

Well, they'd only been playing each other since they first met, nearly 5 months ago when their families booked the same time slot for a school tour. The two had hit it off and exchanged contact information.

Somehow they managed it without learning each others names.
