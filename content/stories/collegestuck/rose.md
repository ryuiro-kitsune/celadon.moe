The other side of the door stood a short haired girl wearing a grey sweater, a pleated skirt, and cherry red makeup.

"Who are you?"

The girl smiled, "Why, my dear David, you don’t recognize me? I would have thought after 8 years you’d know your friends, be they online or real life."

Dave stared at her.

She sighed, "My name is Rose Lalonde. We have been online friends since we were in elementary school."

"Yeah," Dave said while scratching the back of his head, "I kinda don’t buy that. At most Rose told you to prank me."

"I&#x2026;" Rose said, "Why don’t you believe me! I’m Rose! Your friend!"

"Listen Ma’am," Dave said, "you don’t look like Rose. Rose has long hair and dresses like a reject from Hot Topic. In addition to that, the likelyhood of Rose going this far for a joke is dumb. So you’re not her."

The two stared at each other for a moment before Rose broke down and burst out laughing.

"Hahaha, I&#x2026;I can’t believe it. My schemes cancelled themselves out."

She grabbed her wallet from a skirt pocket and fished out her State ID. Rose Lalonde, Iowa.

"I am Rose Lalonde."

Dave blinked at her, "Then why do you look like&#x2026;un-gothy."

"I thought it would be humourous if I changed up my appearence to shock you. Well, that and the fact that I’ve changed my outlook on life since freshman year of highschool."

"Okay, sure. Makes sense and all that shit, but why are you here? Like, surely you wouldn’t follow me to this school as a joke. I know you have aspirations and shit."

She sighed, "It was honestly a coincidence. My mother and and sister were already here, so I followed them."

"So, the same reason I’m here." He said. "Whoo legacy hire," he added flatly.

"Indeed."

Dave sighed, "Hi Rose."

"Hello Dave."

"I ruined your joke, didn’t I?"

Rose smiled, "Perhaps, but the bulk of the joke was the slow realization that you’ll have to deal with me for four years."

"Yeah, assuming we don’t drive each other crazy."

"Or anyone else for that manner."

They smiled at each other for a moment before Dave started again, "Come on, lemme introduce you to John."
