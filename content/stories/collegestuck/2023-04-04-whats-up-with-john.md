"Now boarding flight 413620 to Denver Colorado. Repeat, now boarding flight 413620 to Denver Colorado."

The father stood up and clapped his hands together, "Alright gang! Ready to head off into a new tommorow?"

The twins, John and Jade, rolled their eyes in sync.

"Now, now," he continued, "this is an excedingly important time in a young man and woman’s life."

"Dad," John said, "that’s what you tell us when we’re checking into our dorms..."

"Not when we’re boarding the plane to the layover," Jade finished.

"Pish posh! Every step on your journey matters!"

The twins smiled to themselves, gathered their bags, and followed their dad into his new tommorow.
