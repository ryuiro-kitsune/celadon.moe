<div class="verse">

After years of just being a person,<br />
being myself, I've realized I've started<br />
changing. Changing into something that I<br />
don't feel can be called me.<br />
Everything I was is still somewhere in there<br />
for me to find. But all the while it's<br />
growing into new and alien forms.<br />
How am I still the same?<br />
<br />
I was told as a child that every<br />
journey, every day, every<br />
kiss, would have me be<br />
lead to a more complete<br />
me. In the mirror I could<br />
not see the same person who I<br />
once was. But I think that its<br />
possible now.<br />
<br />
Questionable actions from my past circle<br />
'round me as I stand taking in the change.<br />
Surely this is the end of my journey. My<br />
time to change is over, I can now be the<br />
ultimate form of myself. I now can<br />
view the me that will be and the me that<br />
was together. But now I see the tug of the<br />
xerography machine, pulling me to change<br />
yet again. It accelerates me, causing me to<br />
zoom around the corner, permanently stumbling<br />
always into a new, different world. Oh well,<br />
back to the start I go.<br />
