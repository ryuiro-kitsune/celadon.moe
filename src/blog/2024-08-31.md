title: Am at School

Howdy!

It's been --- *checks last blog post* --- yowsers, 21 days since my last post. Lemme update y'all.

I'm back at school! I took the Amtrak to Iowa and got moved in around a week ago. It's been really nice to be able to listen to IPR again.

I'm partially living off campus this term, so I got a little commute to get to my classes.

Speaking of classes, I'm considering republishing some of my assignments as blog posts. It'll probally come down to whether I'm proud of them and whether I can hack together a citation processor for 11ty. So, possibly look out for that!

Site maintinace has had to take a backseat in the back half of the month, but I'm hoping to get back into the swing of things soonish.

Until next time!
