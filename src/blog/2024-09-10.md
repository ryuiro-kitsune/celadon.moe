title: Roomies birthday
---

As I'm writing this, it's September 10th!

This means a few things: The debate between Harris and Trump, a
student org that tried to protest trans people attending our school is
hosting a 9/11 memorial...on the tenth, but most importantly it means
that today is the 27th anniversary of Roomies and consequently all
subsequent David Willis comics.

I haven't really been into the Willis comics for all that long (only
since my freshman year of college) but I've fallen in love with
Willis's knack for characters that he really cemented with [Dumbing of
Age](https://dumbingofage.com). Each character feels like a real
person you can understand, even if they're in the middle of being the
dumbest motherfucker on the planet.

But, yeah. Thank you David Willis, for making my mornings a bit
brighter. I hope you continue to make comics forever.
