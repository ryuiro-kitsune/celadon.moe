So I've been doing a bit of reading of my childhood books for a college class where we had to present on modern books & I had totally forgotten how good *Wraith Squadron* (the book & the series) was.

I'm tempted to start drafting an article about it (a task so arduous that at the time of writing I have had 4 articles sitting in my drafts for 2 months & not a single one finished) so I'll keep things brief.

It's so good guys. The first book has some decent character development for Kell that really resonated with me when I was younger, the second is so deep into the themes of identity & self image that I could write a paper for English about it, & the third book...okay well I haven't finished the reread yet but I also enjoyed it when I was younger.

Additionally, Lara Nostil is such an intresting character (especially in Book 2) & I'm so glad she got a happy ending.
