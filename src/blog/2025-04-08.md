title: Complaining about my process
draft: true

Greetings friends.
I really like paper. Writing on paper, reading paper books, if it involves paper I'm biased towards it.
This is cool & all, but it does make maintaining celadon.moe really hard.
My normal flow for writing anything is to start in a B5 notebook or on a typewriter. The tactility of ink on paper is just delightful. I finish the draft & then need to retype it into my computer for copyediting & formatting. Then it goes....somewhere, it depends on the project.
Despite my love for the process, it is an absolute pain to do, I'm essentially rewriting the whole article/story from scratch.
The other main issue with the process is my CMS
