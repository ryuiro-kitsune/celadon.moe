Kinda.

It's basically the same from a reader perspective, but now it's being computed from *data*, so I don't have to nail everything together myself.

I'm writing this because there's a slim chance that this will cause the site to break for a few weeks again due to some unforseen bug in the system, so if I'm offline...that's why.
