Silicon Valley never seems to comprehend that cars & horses served the same basic purpose & the early ones were pretty much faster horses.

The other thing that they don't seem to ever comprehend is that (as the article linked points out) you can't just change things randomly & assume they'll work out. Muddling practically never works out for these companies, we don't want to completely rethink out relationship with the platform, we want a horseless carriege that works well enough to get us to where we need to go.
