So, I'm into fountain pens. They're my go to writing instrument whenever I need to lay down some words on paper & they feel very spiffy, very chic. I now have three of them: A Lamy Safari ^[Naturally] that I swap between a 1.9mm italic & medium nib, a pen a family friend made (pictured below) that also seems to have a medium nib, & as of yesterday a Kawako Sport in double broad.

I also went down the bottled ink rabbit hole immediatly, buying two bottles of Waterman ink ^[Tender Purple & Audacious Red]. I've been slowly working my way through those for a period of time I refuse to check, but I wanted to try out some new inks as well, I bought two but the subject of my vexation in Lamy's Lilac Reissue.

It's...uh. iykyk.

It's the first ink that my opinion on varies so radically based on the pen it's in. In my dip pens & with the italic lamy nib it looks godawful, like a bile stain on the paper. (Scans are on a flatbed btw.)

But with the Kawako Sport BB. It looks, fine? Like it's not my favorite ink & it still has that ugly sheen in places, but it's more than usuable.

So yeah, I'd avoid this one if you're in the market for purple ink.
