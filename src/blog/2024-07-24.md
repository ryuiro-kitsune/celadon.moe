title: Boots!

I got hiking boots!

This is probably the most symbolic thing I've done towards my goal of starting hiking and backpacking, because the boots were what drew me to this.

My plan is to take them out camping in Stough Canyon, up the hill from where I live. Once I go on the hike, I will post pictures on this site.

Have a good day!
