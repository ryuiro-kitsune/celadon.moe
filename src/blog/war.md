I've been absolutely obsessed with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-jMqV28dxM) song by Pitbull these past few days.

It was made when he was between labels & isn't available on streaming.

It's...god how do I describe this fucking song.

It uses the instrumental from [Impatiant by Will.I.Am](https://song.link/i/1443260763) which is also used in the songs [American Boy](https://song.link/us/i/1349339895), [Party Time](https://song.link/i/1767691909), [Chug Jug](https://song.link/y/Z0Uh3OJCx3o). So it already is part of an unhinged lineage, albeit one that mostly came after.

Seriously what the fuck do I do with this song?

Pitbull drops a line that's overtly against the Iraq war &mdash; something that wasn't that popular to do at the time &mdash; then follows it up with the [DJ Airhorn SFX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ghmd4QzT9YY). On one hand criticism of the American Industrial Complex on the other Brainrot styled nonsense. Back to back!

This song is a cursed artefact.

Nothing about this song makes sense, but everything flows together into a cohesive whole. The bass drum comes in like an air strike. Pitbull commands me to stand at attention as he criticises the cycle of poverty & accuses Bush of bombing Iraq to line his pockets. The Airhorn plays again. A gunshot rings out, sending me back to the beginning of the song as I sit fucking transfixed. Everything comes around again as Pitbull interpolates [Vietnam era protest music](https://song.link/i/1444049092) & I lack the will to break the cycle & switch off the song.

Is this a good song? I don't know. It's certainly one of the songs of all time, at least.
