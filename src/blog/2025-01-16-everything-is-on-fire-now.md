Yes, I'm being a tad dramatic, but these fire in my home city really suck.

So much ink has been spilled on why this is happening, but the blunt truth is that this will continue to get worse and worse.

Yes, we've always had fires, but it's *not* about the existence of them, it's about the scale. We know for a fact that the reason these extreme weather events are happening more and more is humanity's effects on the climate, and we know for a fact that the only way to fix this is radically decarbonize our infrastructure.

I will spare you the lecture for the time being on why, but I fully support global cooperation on more nuclear power. The great sin of the environmental movement was and is conflating bombs with power plants.
