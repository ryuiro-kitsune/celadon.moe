I got a Royalite^[I don't know what year TT] Typewriter for Christmas this year.

It's a bit scuffed ^[Not that you'd be able to tell from the picture (dither go brrrr)], I wish I had the skills to give it the tune up it deserves, but I've enjoyed writing with it.

That being said, I was absolutely spoiled with my first typewriter: A Smith-Corona Electra 120 in near perfect condition. In addition to the perks of not needing to manually strike the hammers like a manual (lol) typewriter, it also runs so smoothly. Because of this I notice a lot more flaws with the Royalite's ease of use.

My biggest problem is the margin release key not really working. It's not really a problem per se but combined with the unplesant to adjust margins it means I gotta commit to a paper size and deal with whatever comes out.

Still, it's lovely and a lot of flaws due to design and age are forgiven by the fact that it's lighter than my weekly groceries. It's nice being able to fly with a typewriter.

Uh, moral of the story is: get a typewriter, they're great. Just get, like, a well maintained larger unit first so you have a good idea on what they're supposed to feel like first.

Cheers! :smile:
