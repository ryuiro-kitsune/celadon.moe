Guts was the first album I ever bought.

Now, I know basically nothing about writing about music, so let me attempt to beam this information directly into your head: the album is good. Very good even.

I like rock & pop-punk ^[&, assuming it's Chumbawamba, punk] so those 5 tracks are the ones I gravitate to whenever I pop the CD in. Obviously I love [bad idea right?](https://song.link/us/i/1694386828) & [get him back](https://song.link/us/i/1694386841) â€” but I think that of this half of the album ^[well, not half, per se, the tracks are interspersed & *\*bonk\**] shines just as bright (if not brighter) with [ballad of a homeschooled girl](https://song.link/us/i/1694386833) & [love is embarrassing](https://song.link/us/i/1694386843). I think part of the reason I particularly liked those latter to songs, aside from the fact that they do indeed rock, is that the capture the existential angst of being a young adult, of which I am^[Oh God she's only a year older than me.]. bad idea right & get him back are excellent songs, but I personally have not had the experiences described in those songs, but bombing at a party & doing dumbass things because of my emotions are things I've 100%.

Okay as I was writing that last sentence the chorus & bridge of get him back kicked in & it is fantastic. All five of the songs are great & I'm pretending Vampire doesn't exist.

But what about the rest/most of the album?

Ehhhhhhhhh. They're good, but they're not for me most of the time. They aren't in any of my playlists, they're never gonna be a song I pop in the disc for, & I'm most likely to skip them when they come up.

That being said, they are still very good. I do still have a few favorites. [lacy](https://song.link/us/i/1694386831) was a breath of fresh air after vampire & has an ethereal quality I really enjoyed. [logical](https://song.link/us/i/1694386840) is the opposite vibes as lacy & acts as a companion to love is embaressing; also those pianos? :chefs-kiss: [pretty isn't pretty](https://song.link/us/i/1694386937) is a great song that is a blend of the rock songs & the downtempo songs, but I usually skip it because it makes me feel absolutely misrable & I am rarely in a good headspace for that. And then [teenage dream](https://song.link/us/i/1694386938) is the best song on the album.

Also [vampire](https://song.link/us/i/1694386830) is here. I don't like it very much to be honest. Despiete not being the track I'm most likely to skip while listening to the album, it certainly is my least favorite. It's not the worst song ever written, but I just don't care most days. It slips off my mind like water on a ducks back.

But regardless, this is a great album that I think most people should listen to. If you want a sampler platter, I'd reccomend:

- [love is embarrassing](https://song.link/us/i/1694386843)
- [bad idea right?](https://song.link/us/i/1694386828)
- [lacy](https://song.link/us/i/1694386831)
- [teenage dream](https://song.link/us/i/1694386938)

Comment box should be open, so feel free to share your own thoughts about this album/why vampire is good actually & I have bad taste.

Cheers! :)
