Why do we keep giving Nazis control of every narritive they ask for?

If a Nazi wants a cultural artefact, we give it to them. If a Nazi wants a religion, we let them do whatever they want with it. If a Nazi wants us to attack them in a way that makes them look good, we angerly ask for the time & place before releasing thinkpieces in order to make the ones who don't want to be deputized by the SS feel like bigots. Why do we insist on doing this? Are we allergic to tactics, to knowing our history?

Probally.

I don't mean to sound defeatist, but leftists are very bad about counteracting Nazi narritives.

There's a very good left wing YouTube show called [Some More News]() & in one of their more recent episodes (at time of drafting) they fully bite at the Nazi narritive that all gothic lettering is something that we should associate with them (the Nazi Party). This is propaganda & it is embarassing that they do not even think to question it in an episode about what we should be doing during a fascist regime, it's almost as embarassing as the visual example they show not being a different font from a different gothic *family*, only for the host to emphatically claim that they were the exact same font. It's sloppy & it cedes ground to Nazis from that sloppiness.

And if you didn't know, gothic lettering  wasn't invented by the Nazis, not by a goddamn mile. It's not totally clear the exact point of orgin of the form, but current thought is that the letters originated in France. The scripts evolved mainly to save paper as secular books exploded in popularity in the late medival period. Germany have a few blackletter forms that were unique to them & did use gothic letters in printing for a long time, but Germany is not the Nazi Party & *even if* we accept that gothic lettering is something that makes Germany special (which isn't true), conflating Germany or the German people with the Nazis is a lie that the Nazis wanted you to believe.

This is just an example that I know enough to dismiss offhand, but how many times a day do we, as leftists, casually repeat lies & propaganda made by our enemies.
