I don't think I should have an rss feed for my notes, I think that the RSS "usecase" is better for longer (>600ch) posts and rapid short posts would clog up people's readers. I know [other people](http://scripting.com/) have done [it](http://scripting.com/2024/12/01.html#a204028) and I don't find it annoying, but I don't wanna be discourteous to my peers yk. If I'm pushing to an rss reader I want things to actually be substantive.
