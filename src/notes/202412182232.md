Not how journalism works, [mate](http://scripting.com/2024/12/17.html#a222925). Journalism is more than Cable TV. Journalists *do* exist in Red States. Trump is suing some of them right now actually. If you want them to keep existing, cancel your damn cable and buy some newspapers subscriptions in the Midwest.
