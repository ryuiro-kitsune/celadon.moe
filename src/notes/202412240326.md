Look, I get what [Motherfucing Website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) is doing and their criticism is valid. But can we not pretend the default raw html word wrapping isn't garbage on widescreen displays. Shit fucking hurts to read and because of that isn't doing its job well.

Look, I know I'm highly opinionated about this (I submit my CSS file as proof) but if you're gonna go the hyper-minamilist route for a site please just center all the text and wrap it at 100 chars. Please.
