Pink Pony Club is a lovely sounding song that minorly bugs me every time I hear it because I've grown to dislike the idea of LA as a magical land that fixes all your problems. Go home, we have problems we're trying to deal with.

If you have issues, you're still gonna have those issues but now you're in LA with stars in your eyes (& rapidly approaching depression as you don't book anything).

I want you to move here, but because you want to *be* here, not for a dream that won't materialize.
