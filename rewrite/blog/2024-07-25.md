I ended up going to a bookshop yesterday and picked up three books.

- [Quit your Dayjob by Eleanor Whitney](https://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/books/8893)
- [How to Survive the Woods](https://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/zines/3821)
- The Ring of Truth by Clint Marsh

I'll try to do quick reviews/writeups on these as I finish them.
