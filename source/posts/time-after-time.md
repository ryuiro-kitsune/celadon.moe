Two women stood in a stony ring, waiting for the other to make a move.

Jane Watson stared at her opposite across the ring. The woman's face considerably more scarred than her own but, aside from that, identical as her twin would be. <sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>

"Are you me?" Jane asked the woman, "because I would like to make this simple and quick, and my current thoughts are to beat you the fuck up."

"Fighting is useless, my dear Watson," her voice, cat-like and low, floated across to Jane on the wind<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>, "talking this out is the only way to make this quick, and of course simple."

Jane's hand, trembling slightly with anticipation, tightened around her golden pocket watch in preparation for the fight to come. <sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> "Not an answer, Blondie," she shouted back, "you'll fight me? <sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>"

The woman began strolling closer to the center. "In order to hopefully answer your question, I am called Amelia and am not strictly you---<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>but, to answer you more directly, no, you cannot defeat me in a fight; nor I, you <sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>."

Jane eyed her while the woman slowly stalked towards her<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup>, "I don't follow."

On hearing this she became a statue, frozen in the image of her catlike motions. <sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup>

"I suppose <sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup> you wouldn't, my dear watson. I've had the pleasure of having multiple hundreds of iterations of this encounter so I always assume you have information you do not, however, I am not an uncharitable opponent and I will gladly bring you up to speed with myself in order to make this confrontation fair and balanced<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup>."

Without batting an eye, Jane lunged towards the woman with intention to strike her down as she was speaking on the nature of striking. <sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup>

"Well then, I shall see you soon Watson," the woman sighed.

The room sprizzed <sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12" role="doc-backlink">12</a></sup> around the pair. Jane found herself punching air as the woman traveled away to an infinite number of possible temporal locations. Well, seemingly infinite. In reality, she merely traveled seconds after the punch would have connected, saving her the effort of dodging.<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13" role="doc-backlink">13</a></sup>

To an outside observer, the following fight must have bordered on an incomprehensibility that rivaled directly viewing on an eldritch being<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14" role="doc-backlink">14</a></sup>. The women were jetting back and forth across a time span that lasted mere minutes. The air was so thick with the effects of the pair's time travel that the whole arena looked like it was underwater<sup><a id="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15" role="doc-backlink">15</a></sup> Soon, the effects of the straining of the structure of space-time <sup><a id="fnr.16" class="footref" href="#fn.16" role="doc-backlink">16</a></sup> bled into the surroundings.

Every five or some micro-seconds a ghostly apparition would fade in and out&#x2014;never in the same location twice in a row. An Amelia there, a Jane there. Together they formed a fog<sup><a id="fnr.17" class="footref" href="#fn.17" role="doc-backlink">17</a></sup> that settled onto the arena, a boiling toxic fog that turned all outsiders into a bloody mess from accidental blows that the pair delivered onto the unfortunate inter-loper, even as they failed to land a single one on the other.  <sup><a id="fnr.18" class="footref" href="#fn.18" role="doc-backlink">18</a></sup>

As minutes passed from the location's perspective, hours from Amelia's, and days from Jane's <sup><a id="fnr.19" class="footref" href="#fn.19" role="doc-backlink">19</a></sup> the space itself started to become distorted as timelines and specters of possibility formed and fizzled out faster that one could notice them. Logic and cause and effect begun to break down after they were repeatedly thwarted, overwritten, and erased. Reality and nothingness merged to cope with the damage the women were doing to the fabric to reality, and broke into infinite spirals.

<p class="verse">
A girl sits on a grain of sand <sup><a id="fnr.20" class="footref" href="#fn.20" role="doc-backlink">20</a></sup>. Drinking water<br />

</p>

&#x2014; Then suddenly, Jane stumbled and it was all over.

The superpositions of the infinite timelines collapsed into a single outcome once more. .

"See, my dear Watson," she said to the fuming woman [fn:26, "fighting is utterly useless to two people of our skills."

"I will," Jane gasped, breathless, "defeat you!"

Jane grabbed her watch for a final time and left the field. Amelia sighed and sat down in the center.

"I'm never going to find a version of us that will listen, am I," Amlelia mused utterly unperturbed<sup><a id="fnr.23" class="footref" href="#fn.23" role="doc-backlink">23</a></sup>, "oh well, the next one may prove me wrong.

A woman sat in a stony ring, waiting for the other to find her once again <sup><a id="fnr.24" class="footref" href="#fn.24" role="doc-backlink">24</a></sup>.
