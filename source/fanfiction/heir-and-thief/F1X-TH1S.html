<p>Our <span class="vriska">Thief</span> stands on the precipice of her greatest acomplishment, the death of Jack Noir.</p>
<p>Well, it would be more accurate to say this is what she beilived. In reality she stood on the precipice of her death at the hands of the <span class="terezi">Seer of Mind</span>, who knew that if she let her go, everyone both of them ever cared about would be torn down by the very creature she dared to challenge, like tissues in a torrent of bloody rain.</p>
<p>However, all is not lost for our <span class="vriska">Thief</span>. As her hero arrives to save her.</p>
