Greetings friends.

My name is Celadon Camellia, or Cellie for short. I'm a third year college student currently splitting my time in between Ceder Rapids, Iowa and Los Angeles, California. I've been tinkering with websites for a few years now and have fallen in love with the process.

My pronouns are He/Him.
