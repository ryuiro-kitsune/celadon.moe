I'm working on my other site right now (no you can't see it, it's for irlfolk) and I'm so tempted to use Jason as my pre-generation file format because I will have a CMS this time.

Obviously it doesn't make sense for long form text, but I'm mainly a notes poster and I can always use markdown for longer stuff.
