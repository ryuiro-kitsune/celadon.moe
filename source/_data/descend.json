I never did that, but everyone else tellsme that they made their best friends in some-club-or-other.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERosie nodded in contemplation, carefully considering what her olderbrother said.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe carried on with his lesson, \u0022Something that I undervalued backwhen I was starting out was showing up to classes.  I didn't think itwould be that hard to do&#x2014;\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERosie's eyes widened, \u0022You cut classes?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe immediently backpedaled, \u0022Oh no no no no! I could never!

I was trying to tell you that you shouldn't cutclass!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERosie rolled her eyes, all traces of a mock-professor/student dynamichaving faded into the mundanity of sibling dynamics.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Anyways,\u0022 Joe continued, \u0022don't be an asshole to people you don'tknow.  It gets more blurry with your friends, but I'd reccomend notsaying anything too mean to them as well.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Joe, that is the most self-obvious piece of advice I've everheard,\u0022 Rosie said, \u0022is the next nugget gonna be \u0022don't murder yourteachers\u0022 or something like that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe snorted, \u0022Oh yeah, little miss swiping at my back when I'mpicking up my sword, you can be ruthless sometimes.\u0022h\u0022Only to people who deserve to know that what they said was asinineas hell,\u0022 Rosie said, \u0022and I apologized for the backstab already,Jesus Christ Joe.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe grinned, \u0022Relax Rosie, I'm kidding.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThere was a long pause as a look of worry knit itself across Rosie'sface.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERosie sighed and finally spoke up, \u0022Hey Joe?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe paused for a moment before continuing, \u0022Should I try to givemyself a new nickname? Rosie just feels so childish and youngsounding.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Uh,\u0022 Joe leaned back further into the couch's pile of pillows andblankets as if he could escape his uncertainty, \u0022I don't know.  Ikind of know where you're coming from, if that helps at all.  Joeisn't exactly the coolest name in the book, and Joey and Joseph aren'ta whole lot better.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe ran her fingers through her hair distractedly, \u0022Does it reallymatter what my nickname is? Am I over-thinking it?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EFrom the pillows, Joe said, \u0022I don't think it matters a whole lot,honestly.  I guess as long as you stay true to who you are andwhatever.  Names have power, but as long as the label you stick onyourself doesn't subsume your very \u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Joe?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022That was the most incoherent self-indulgy monologue I've heard in along time.  Have you been thinking a lot about this?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022No,\u0022 Joe started, \u0022maybe.  I said it before, Joe is a bit of a lamename.  It gives the impression of a middle age football coach whopeaked in high-school.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022You're young, there's still time for that\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe got out of the cushions and half heartedly swiped at his sister.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Shut up.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Never,\u0022 she said, \u0022anyways.  What about Rose?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Huh? Oh right.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe thought for a few moments before nodding his head in approval.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I like Rose, it feels clever.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERose beamed and said, \u0022Like me!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe ignored the comment, \u0022Do you think I should take on a nicknametoo? I know its really too late to, but I've got a strange feelingthat I ought to, you know?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERose considered her words carefully before speaking again, \u0022I thinkthat's a personal question, Joe.  Besides, its not really too late.You can always adopt a screenname, seperate from your own to useonline.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe sighed and ran his hand through his hair.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah you're right,\u0022 Joe said, \u0022I'll leave it be for the year, andif I come up with an ingenious idea that'll blow everyone's minds withhow cool it is I'll use it next year.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERose punched Joe's shoulder, and said, \u0022That's the spirit.  Justdon't forget your advice.  What was it? Don't let the nickname becomea mask that become all that you are or whatever that means.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Oh shut up, Rosie.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E"

I haven't gotten \u003Ci\u003Eall\u003C/i\u003E the bad teachers, but I'd sure say that all of the ones I've \u003Ci\u003Ehad\u003C/i\u003E today are bad.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Whoemst've?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJess sighed and brushed her hair back behind her ear.

It's just a rumor, but one I'm not thrilled about figuring out the truth behind.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe looked visibly distressed at the final statement, \u0022Jesus Jess. Is there anything I can do?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJess sighed, \u0022I doubt it.  If it turns out that she's a shit person I'll record it and file a complaint with the school, either they deal with the problem or transfer me to a different class to shut me up.

So I'll drop it for now.  But if it does come to that or anything else, please let me know, okay?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJess grinned slightly, \u0022Thanks Joe, I appreciate it.  Don't worry \u003Ci\u003Etoo\u003C/i\u003E much though.  More than likely she'll either be a tolerable annoyance, or the rumors will just be the standard level of true rumors are.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two sat in silence for a few moments.  Joe took the opportunity to get his supplies for class out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe placed his notebook, mechanical pencil, erasers, and pen onto his desk as neatly and deliberately as he could manage.  Everything was to be placed in a coherent manner that allowed for easy access.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe looked around the room in order to figure out who he would be dealing with the rest of the year for sixth period.  It was all the standard people he had been acquainted with for two years now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EActually, there was a new person he hadn't seen before.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe knew he didn't know every single person his grade level in the school, but he had never seen this girl's face before in the two years he had been at the school.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Jess.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo response.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, Jess,\u0022 Joe repeated, this time with a poke accompanying the vocalization.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022What?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Do you see the girl in the corner?

The teacher began introducing herself and in doing so had consequently begun the mundanity and boredom in Joe's mind.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EEvery now and then though, he snuck glances at the new girl, Robyn.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe had an energy about her, one that gave off the impression of disinterest in what outsiders thought of her, of subtle confidence, of being \u0022too cool for school.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe way she carried herself, the way she moved her hair, the way she smirked when she pushed up her aviator shaped glasses, all of it contributed to an undeniable mystique.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAnd before he knew it, Jess was tapping his shoulder and the day was done.\u003C/p\u003E"

In their little game, she was at an advantage due to her smaller size, the only two rules they had were to avoid the head and to steer clear of actual injury that would cause their parents to ask questions about what exactly they did when they went out together.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERose's block wasn't enough to stall the strike, merely slow it, so she was forced to dance closer to the railing on the edge of the roof. The wind was fiercer here, cold and damp.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe two traded blows that they knew the other would be able to avoid or counter back and forth for minutes before Joe, sensing a sluggishness coming into Rose executed the final blow of the game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHe pivoted his feet and swung wide, reversing the blow halfway through and striking the hilt of Rose's blade from below.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe sword leapt from the girl's hand and arced upward, clattering to the ground moments later with a deafening clack&#x2026; and then silence.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe and Rose slowly let their breathing return to normal as the wind cooled them off and dried the sweat on their body.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe restarted the conversation from earlier, \u0022would you like to talk now?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERose's labored breathing approximated a sigh, \u0022not really, but you're incessant curiosity will ask again later, so I might as well.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERose took a deep breath, \u0022all the new people probably think I'm weird now.  I completely blew my chances for normal friends by saying all the wrong things.  I don't know what to do now.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe furrowed his brow, \u0022what did you say?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022One of the boys in my class was talking about looking forward to writing in our English class.  So I ask him about him writing.  If he liked it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EShe was starting to talk quicker now.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022So he says that he writes as a hobby.  I say, \u003Ci\u003Eoh cool\u003C/i\u003E and ask whether he'd want to be a writer when he grows.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHer voice was beginning to loose coherence and devolve into sniffles.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Rose.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022He says yes so I ask about his favorite books, and he says he loves the Hobbit and what not.  So I tell him that fantasy has a bunch of sociological ramifications&#x2026;\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Rose!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022And then.  And then I ask if he's interested in the Psychology of&#x2026;\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022ROSIE!\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERose stopped.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022I asked too many questions, didn't I? I blew my chances didn't I?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe walked over to his sister and hugged her tightly.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Rose, I&#x2026; I don't think you did honestly.  Why do you think you blew the opportunity to make new friends?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERose sounded as if she was crying, but Joe didn't want to break the hug to find out, \u0022He started laughing and I ran.  They all think I'm a loser now, I know it.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe broke the hug to look into Rose's eyes, \u0022Rose, I wasn't there and can't say for certain, but I bet if you went back tomorrow and apologized to him for whatever you think you did, I bet he would forgive you.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022How do you know that?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EJoe put on his best big brother reassuring smile, \u0022I think people are mostly good.  Besides, let's say he views you as weird for asking about things he's not prepared for, do you really want to be friends with someone like that.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022But&#x2026;\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Rose, trust me.  It's better to have one friend you can be yourself with than a hundred friends you have to pretend to be someone else for.  I promise.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERose was visibly calming down, but Joe didn't know how much of that was her feeling better and how much was her pretending to feel better so he would stop worrying about her.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Hey, Rose?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Yeah?\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u0022Let's go downstairs, okay? I think finishing this conversation inside would be best for both of us.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERose unenthusiastically nodded and moved to grab her things.  She didn't look great, but she looked better than she had moments before when she was crying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ci\u003EAnd that,\u0022 Joe reasoned,\u003C/i\u003E was enough for the moment.\u0022\u003C/p\u003E"
