Rose wasn't sleeping, not that she ever slept really. A more accurate statement would be that she merely passed out every 18 odd hours.

In place of sleep on this specific night, she was shooting off messages to her friends across the United State in younger time-zones, filling the time between their replies with putting digital scrawls into her netbook's meager storage space.

She was excited to follow in her sister and mother's footsteps, if not in revolutionizing the scientific disciplines as they aspired to, then by writing a story that would render even the most wretched humans blubbering wrecks of emotion at the sheer brilliance of the story.

Naturally, she would be enrolling in their school's creative writing program. She would have preferred something farther from home, but going to the school that the two of them already were at would save her the obligation of returning home, leaving her free to pursue excellence.

She also couldn't wait for the look on Dave's face when he realized the secret she'd been keeping from him.

He had no idea the utter domination that would follow.
