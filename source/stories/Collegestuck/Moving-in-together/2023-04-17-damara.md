authornote: <p>The challenge in writing Damara is that she has no characterization besides being mean, horny, and japanese. So no matter what you do you're prone to writing her out of character.</p><p>The solution&mdash;like all of the other times I realize I'm writing out of character&mdash;is to not care about it too much and try to make sure that the characters are at least acting in character <em>internally</em>.</p><p>So that's the reason why [insert character here] doesn't behave exactly like their original self in Homestuck.</p><p>Besides, I just have to stay closer to their characterization than the epilougues and I come out ahead. :P</p>

The elevator was silent as Rose ascended.

Rose had poleitly declined her sister's offer to "help her move in," as she had been on campus enough times that she could manage by herself, thank you very much. Besides its not like she had more than a small bag to move in with.

The elevator dinged and the doors opened to the ninth floor of Murray hall. Rose strolled forward to take a peek through the window.

The sight was breathtaking and filled her with feelings of power and bliss. The fact that she could just make out dave's dorm building from the corner of her vision contributed to that feeling.

As she stepped back from the window she absently opened her phone to double check her dorm room number one last time.

903, just like the last four times.

Rose stopped in front of room 903 and delivered a swift and determined rap onto the door.

The door cracked open a tiny bit.

"何これ…" A voice groaned from beheind the door.

Rose cleared her throat, "My name is Rose Lalonde. I'm going to be your roommate this year. Pleased to make your aquantince."

"Fuck," The voice said, "come in."

The door opened slowly and Rose got her first look at her new roomate.

She seemed to be hungover or, at minimum, was not used to getting up before noon. She was wearing a dark red lipstick and eyeshadow that appeared, from the smearing, to have been applied the previous night. Her eyes, which she was rubbing currently, were reddish brown and her skin was only a shade or two darker than her own. Her hair was black and&#x2014;

Rose felt her face grow warm.

She wasn't wearing a top or bra. The only thing covering her&#x2026;Rose's neck twitched&#x2026;ample bust was her long hair.

"I, um, hello&#x2026;You, forgot," she stuttered while gesturing with all the tact of a wilderbeast.

"Hm?" The girl murmered, "Oh. Yeah."

Having realized the issue, she swiped a T-Shirt from on top of her bed and put it on. Inadvertantly flashing Rose even more as she did.

"Yo," the girl said, "I'm Damara. I have a splitting headache, so if you can dump your stuff and leave&#x2026;"

"Um, yes, that's&#x2026;fine."

"Aight, see you tonight or whatever."

Rose carefully set her bag on her bed and left the room significantly less resolute than she entered it.
