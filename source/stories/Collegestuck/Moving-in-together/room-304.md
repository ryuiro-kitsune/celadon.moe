Dave unlocked the door of his dorm room and moved his bags into the room.

He seemed to be the last person on the floor to move into his dorm. He knew it couldn't be true&#x2014;uperclassmen moved in the day after&#x2014;but no one else akwardly had their bags in the hall as they struggled with the deadbolts and that fact alone felt isolating.

"Fuck."

John still wasn't here.

The last Dave heard from him, he had just landed in the Eastern Iowa Airport and was taking the Uber to the school. Dave threw a punch into the air. *I am not ready for this.*

Sure, he had been looking forward to meeting John for years at this point, but&#x2026;

Dave began pacing.

*Fuck.*

Despite Dirk's reassurences, he still wasn't sure John going to this school was a good idea.

*I should have pushed back harder&#x2026;*

Dave sat down on rightmost the bed and let himself fall onto his back.

He stared at the ceiling and felt the minutes drift by.

Then, he heard a knock on his door.

It was time.
