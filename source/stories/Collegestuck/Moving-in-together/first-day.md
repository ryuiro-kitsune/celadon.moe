John Egbert stood on the other side of the door holding a single suitcase.

Dave slowly unlatched the door and pulled it open towards himself. John had a massive smile on his face.

He said something but Dave couldn't hear through the rush of blood in his head.

Dave stumbled forward and wordlessly hugged John, squeezing him tight to reassure himself that he wouldn't leave.

John nestled under Dave's chin and Dave could feel him say something else from the vibration.

The two broke the hug and John brought his bag into their new home for the next year.
