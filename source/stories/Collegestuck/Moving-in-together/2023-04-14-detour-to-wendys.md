Dave's phone vibrated in his pocket about 40 miles outside the city limits. He took it out and replied to Rose.
<div class="chat">

Dave sighed and put his phone to sleep.

Dirk glanced over at him, "Who ya talkin to, bro?"

"Rose," Dave replied, "she's a&#x2026;friend."

"Well, that seems convincing," Dirk said with a voice saturated with sarcasm, "she your secret girlfriend, or something?"

Dave burst out laughing, "Jesus friggin Christ no! She and I have a purely platonic relationship based on ironic flirting and fucking with the other."

"Sounds like a girlfriend," Dirk said while adjusting the GPS.

Dave snorted, "Yeah, like you'd know. The year you graduated you were the head of the GSA and organized a Pride Parade."

"I coulda been bi."

"Are you?"

"Not telling. You wanna stop at wendy's before we get there?"

"Why wendy's?"

Dirk chuckled, "There's one a block from the school, so whenever I'd miss dinner for whatever reason, I'd walk through the drive through and order food."

"You are&#x2026;something else."

"Is that a yes."

"Eh, fuckit. Why not?"

"Hell yeah!"

Dave felt another buzz and quickly replied to the final Rose text of the day.

<div class="chat">
<span class="rose">TT: i need your dorm address</span><br />
<span class="rose">TT: so i can send you mail</span><br />
<span class="dave">TG: yeah sure, whatever</span><br />
<span class="dave">TG: greene 304</span>
