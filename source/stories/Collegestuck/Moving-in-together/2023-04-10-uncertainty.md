The car ride was quiet. Dirk had the wheel of his dingy Honda Civic and had the aux, causing the only sound to be the faint pop music coming from the speakers.

"So bro, you ready for your new life of freedom?"

Dave stared out of the car window at the endless fields of nothing and farmland.

"Bro? You alive over there."

Dave continued staring.

"We're all we're gonna have for this next year, you gotta be able to talk to me about things Dave."

"Why did you choose Iowa?" His voice was quieter than it was in public, like satin to denim, "I've been thinking about it for the past three hours, but I don't know the reason that of all the schools in Texas, of all the schools in the *country*, why'd you pick a school in not even the largest city in Iowa?"

Dirk adjusted the center mirror to look at the car beheind them, "Why is this weighing on your consious now and not when I applied two years ago?"

Dave sat in silence, "Because I'm following you now, and John is following me. Your descion matters, it didn't then. It just was one more impulsive descion you'd made in a long line of impulsive descions."

"Dude, where's this coming from? You should have said something when you were fucking applying."

"Fuck off, I didn't know John was going to apply to the same college as me! He didn't even ask why I was applying!"

The car was silent once again. After two miles clicked by, Dirk finally replied.

"I applied because Roxy's mom works here. She was my only friend by the end of school so I wanted to be with her."

"&#x2026;is it a good school."

"I would have told you to go somewhere else if it wasn't at least okay."

The car was silent for a long while after that.
