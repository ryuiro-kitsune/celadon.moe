A young man stands in the middle of a stage with a spotlight trained on him. His physical appearence is largely unimportant, but he is 5'9'' and wearing a sweater-vest.

"Howdy!" He says to the audience&#x2014;that is to say, you.

"I'm Celadon, the author of this little webseries. My family recently went to the Requium cafe and that has given me some perspective on just how short these dumbasses are."

Rose leaned out from back stage and spoke to Celadon, "Are you sure you're not wildly misplacing the time when these images. We start Homestuck at 13, you know."

Celadon rolled his eyes, "Please, because of the fact we can clearly see the Alpha kids in the same picture, that means you've all gotta be 16&#x2014;"

"Flawed logic," Rose said, "the scale could just have easily been normalized at 13."

"Counterpoint, Rose," he said, "I'm the author and that means I'm right."

"Counter to your counter," she said while walking towards the center of the stage, "the majority of us being under 5 feet is patently absurd and, besides, Death of the Author says&#x2014;"

Celadon ran his hands through his hair in frustration, "You know what! Fuck this, if I arbitrarily add a little height will you stop badgering me on this."

"Yes."

"Fan-fucking-tastic. Okay lemme just&#x2014;"

Celadon sat down at the lip of the stage and pulled out a reporter's notepad.

He stuck his hands in his pockets a few times and cursed.

"Fuck shit fuck. Heya, Rosie?"

"Yes?"

"You wouldn't happen to have a copy of my fountain pen, would you? I didn't expect to do math in this avatar and forgot to give me it."

"As absolutly stupendously asinine as this whole premise is, I do, in fact, have a fountain pen."

She walked over to him and handed it over.

"Doumo, doumo. Okay, so if x is your initial height and y is your final heights&#x2014;"

Celadon scribbled in his notebook as he did the calculations. For a few minutes, before tearing off the sheet and handing it to Rose.

"Okay, first off. You're 5'3'' now."

"Acceptable."

"Awesome, pass this around to everyone back there."

Rose nodded and began walking back stage.

"And also," Celadon shouted back to her and, by extention, everyone else, "if I hear one word of complaint, I'm changing all of you to be 4'3''!"
