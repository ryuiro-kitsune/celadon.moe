John was excited.
</p>

<p>
In less than 24 hours, he would board a plane and fly to the first day of the rest of his life, to College!
</p>

<p>
He and his best friend in the whole world were finally going to be able to meet irl. He was going to have a college experience just like the movies, surrounded by his friends that he was going to make as soon as he got there.
</p>

<p>
He carefully repacked all of his posters, books, and clothes into his suitcases and got ready once again for the morning. He began pacing around his room making sure every little thing was ready for the next day.
</p>

<p>
If he forgot a single thing, his dad couldn't drive from Washington to Iowa to deliver it, so he needed to get this right.
</p>

<p>
After he made sure everything was ready, he crawled into bed and tried to fall asleep.
</p>

<p>
He just knew Dave must be just as excited to see him too!
