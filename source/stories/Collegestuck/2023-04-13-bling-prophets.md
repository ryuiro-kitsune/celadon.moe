### Very Normal Dorm Decor

Terezi Pyrope paced back and forth considering every angle. She needed to get a holistic view of her decorations if she was to craft a perfect display of her personality.

Once she had examined every inch of her side of her dorm room, she got to work tying the ropes for her masterpiece.

20 minutes later, she was done. It was a perfect display of her inner self, of how she saw the world.

"You know, Rezi," her roommate, having just walked in, said, "the hanged stuffies makes it pretty difficult for me to bring anyone to our dorm."

"Hehehe," she cackled, "then my plan is succes---ow!"

She nursed the bruise on her forhead as Vriska picked back up her book and left the dorm.

### Ascii Gamer

In the early hours of the morning, Vriska woke up and groped in the darkness for her glasses.

"Ugh, this never gets easier," she mumbled as she found them and brought them under her covers.

"Ow, fucking jackass," she said as she poked herself in the eye.

Once she got them on she steeled herself momentarily before throwing off her blanket and getting out of her bed.

"Morning 'Rezi," she said while rubbing her eyes, still groggy.

Terezi didn't look up from her laptop. She had been gaming all night and had her headphones on.

"Yo 'Rezi," Vriska pulled off her headphones and then promptly dropped them in horror.

"...PERIOD PERIOD PERIOD PERCENT WHITE BOLD NUMBER BLUE PERIOD PERIOD PERIOD..."

"WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ARE YOU LISTENING TO. IT SOUNDS LIKE A ROBOT MANIFESTO."

Terezi turned around to look up at her roommate, "Oh good morning Vriska."

Terezi's smiling face broke Vriska, "H-how, what the hell..."

"Oh, this?" Terezi tapped her headphones, "I'm blind so I use a screen reader to play games in my terminal, it reads me every character on screen so I know where everything is."

"Bullshit. That's Bullshit, that cannot be how that works."

Terezi grinned, "Oh? Whatcha gonna do? Prove me wrong? Prove I don't play all my games this way? Howdju expect to do that, Vrissy?"

Vriska stared at her for a few minutes and left the dorm, disturbed and afraid.

### Do It Yourself

The sewing machine thrumming with rhythmic simplicity was the only sound in the library.

As soon as she finished the stich she was working on, Terezi swiftly double tapped the watch on her wrist, causing it vibrate the time in morse code. 23:30.

She frowned, she was up later than she had planned and she only was halfway done with Cherrytongue's body.

She sighed and shut off the sewing machine, the library was closing in a half hour and she'd rather stop at this natural break rather than be forced to abandon her work later.

She could finish tommorow anyways.
