    <p>Our Thief stands on the precipice of her greatest acomplishment, the death of Jack Noir.</p>
    <p>Well, it would be more accurate to say this is what she beilived. In reality she stood on the precipice of her death at the hands of the Seer of Mind, who knew that if she let her go, everyone both of them ever cared about would be torn down by the very creature she dared to challenge, like tissues in a torrent of bloody rain.</p>
    <p>However, all is not lost for our <span class="vriska">Thief</span>. As her hero arrives to save her.</p>
    -->
    <p>Vriska is preparing to face Jack Noir and acchive her greatest accomplishment --- his death. She knows she is likely to die and so has been tugging the mask of self confidence more and more firmly onto her face.</p>
    <p>She hears footsteps. She tugs once more at the mask and closes her laptop.</p>
    <p><span class="vriska">"H8y Terezi. I was just leav8ng."</span></p>      
    <p>Terezi noted Vriska's erratic 8 use and narrowed her eyes.</p>
    <p><span class="terezi">"1M GO1NG TO G1V3 YOU ON3 CH4NC3, FOR OLD T1M3S S4K3. 1F TH1S CO1N L4NDS H34DS...3GB3RT? WH4T TH3&mdash;</span></p>
    <p><span class="vriska">"John????????"</span></p>
    <p><span class="vriska">"What are you doing heAUGH!!!!!!!!"</span></p>
    <p><span class="john">"KAPOW!!!!!"</span></p>
    <p><span class="terezi">"JOHN NO! >:O"</span></p>
    <p>John, dressed his pajama shaped wind-sock appears and thougroughly knocks out Vriska. Following Terezi's instructions to the letter.</p>

    <p class="terezi">3G3RT WH4T TH3 H3LL 4R3 YOU DO1NG H3R3??? 4R3N'T YOU SUPOSS3D B4CK SCR4TCHING YOUR S3SS1ON????</p>

    <p>John grins wildly after the rush of knocking out his alternate universe ex-girlfriend/girlfriend/mortal-enemy/friend. <span class="john">"I'm on a trans-timeline caper with you Terezi! Or, I hope its a caper, so far it seems to just me solving your boyfriend issues and stealing plushies. :("</span></p>

    <p class="terezi">"W41T YOUR3 TH3 ON3 WHO K33PS ST34L1NG MY SC4L3M4T3S???? HOW 1S TH1S...N3V3R M1ND, 1 DONT C4R3. WHY D1D YOU KNOCK OUT VR1SK4?"</p>
    <p><span class="john">"Weren't you going to kill her? I'm saving her life!</span> John asked somewhat incredulously</p>
    <p class="terezi">"W3LL Y3S, BUT TH4T ST1LL DO3SNT R34LLY 3XPL41N WHY YOU W3NT OUT OF YOU W4Y TO S4V3 H3R WH3N YOU HAVE B1GG3R CR1M1N4LS TO C4TCH. W41T, 1S TH1S B3C4US3 OF TH4T DUMB CRUSH YOU H4V3 ON H3R?"</p>
    <p><span class="john">"I don't have a crush on her!"</span> John starts to trail off, <span class="john">"well, not anymore I guess..."</span></p>
    <p>But then, John gets a second wind, <span class="john">"Besides, I'm not the one who decided to save Vriska!</span> John vaguely waves the scarf he's been holding this entire time in the general direction of Terezi, <span class="john">"You were!"</span></p>
    <p>John suddenly realized what was about to happen.</p>
    <p class="john">"Oh fuck"</p>
    <p>Terezi attempts to grab the scarf while John, thinking quickly, has sticks his hand straight up in the air and has the breeze hold it in the shape of a line pointing straight up from his hand.</p>
    <p>Terezi punches him in the stomach and the scarf floats gracfully to the floor."</p>
    <p><span class="terezi">"H4H4H4, M1N3 NOW. >:] NOW L3TS S33 WH4TS R34LLY GO1NG, HUH?"</span> Terezi looks at the doubled over John with concern, <span class="terezi">"TH1S 1S D3F1N4TLY BOTH MY WR1T1NG 4ND MY BLOOD. PL34S3 T3LL M3 YOU 4R3NT CR34T1NG 4 DOOM3D T1M3L1N3 W1TH MY H3LP"</span></p>
    <p>John takes a few seconds to get his breath back from the jab to his midsection.</p>
    <p class="terezi">"3GB3RT. 3GB3RT. TH1S 1S K1ND4 1MPORT4NT EGB3RT. JOHN. JOHN. JOH---4H FUCK 1 C4NT S33 4NYTH1NG"</p>
    <p>The wind briefly swirls around her head, dispersing the smells and tastes that Terezi uses to detect her environment, the effect vanishes just as quickly as it appears, its purpose as a revenge prank fulfilled.</p>
    <p class="john">"Now we're even, Jerk. :P"</p>
    <p class="terezi">"..."</p>
    <p class="terezi">"1 4SK3D YOU 4 QU3ST1ON, W1S34SS"</p>
    <p class="john">"Its...complicated. Long story short, no. Whatever we do is what we were always supposed to do."</p>
    <p>Terezi lightly snorts and tosses the scarf back in John's general direction, <span class="terezi">"L13 TO M3 4ND YOULL N3V3R 3SC4P3 TH3 H4ND OF JUST1C3"</span></p>
    <p>The breeze floats the scarf into John's hand once more, <span class="john">"I promise that we know&mdash;<em>I know</em> what I'm doing. I wouldn't be doing this if I thought that I'd be able to somehow make things worse. Trust me."</span></p>
    <p>Terezi leaned heavily of her sword and stared at John.</p>
    <p class="john">"What?"</p>
    <p class="terezi">"4RNT YOU GONN4 T4K3 H3R?"</p>
    <p class="john">"What do you mean?"</p>
    <p class="terezi">"FOR FUCKS S4K3 3GB3RT D1DNT YOU R34D TH3 FUCK1NG SC4RF? YOUR3 SUPPOS3D TO, 4ND 1 QUOT3, 'T4K3 TH4T CR4ZY B1TCH TO WH3R3V3R YOU FUCK1NG W3R3 THOS3 P4ST THR33 Y34RS SO SH3 DO3SNT FUCK UP TH3 M3T3OR'"</p>
    <p><span class="john">"What? I don't remember seeing that,"</span> John glances down at the scarf and rereads the message about Vriska, <span class="john">Knock that her out so I don't kill her...oh you're right. Take that crazy bitch to wherever you fucking were for the past three years, etc."</span> John looks Terezi in the eyes, <span class="john">"but why? She would've gone with you if you hadn't killed her?"</span></p>
    <p>Terezi starts pacing, <span class="terezi">"1M NOT GO1NG TO PR3T3ND 1 KNOW TH3 FULL S1TU4T1ON H3R3, BUT 1 TH1NK 1 M4Y H4V3 SOM3 1NS1GHT.

    <p>Terezi and John stare at each other for a few moments before John doubles over in laughter.</p>
    <p><span class="john">I'm glad that you've always been this intense and it wasn't just a response to the situation. :) See you Rezi!"</span>John says as he turns and goes to grab Vriska for her metaphysical Uber.</p>
    <p class="terezi">"W41T WH4T DO YOU M34N BY TH4T? WH4T S1TU4T1ON?"</p>
    <p>A sudden Karkat appears.</p>
    <p class="karkat">WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON HERE. WHY IS EGBERT HERE, <em>HOW</em> IS EGBERT HERE, AND WHY IS VRISKA ON THE FLOOR?</p>
    <p>John dashes over to Vriska's body as she sluggishly regains consciousness. He holds onto her shoulder and smiles at the rapidly increasing number of trolls.</p>
    <p><span class="john">"See you guys soon! :)"</span> He says before jumping back to the moment he and Jade left their session, now with Vriska in tow.</p>
