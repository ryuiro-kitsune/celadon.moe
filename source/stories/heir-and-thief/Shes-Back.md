The Heir and the Thief coalesce back into physical forms from the breeze that carried them. The Thief remains in her prone position from before, with the Heir holding her head up.

Vriska barely has time to get her bearings on the prospitian ship she finds herself on before the grip around her slackens.

She hears a <span class="john">"See you later, Vriska!"</span> as John dissolves back into wind and slips between the panels once more.

Vriska's head awkwardly clunks against the metal floor, causing her to let out a deep sigh. <span class="vriska">"What the fuck is going on?"</span>

All the adreneline that was coursing through her faded into the dull throb of her regrets. She had been "just moving forward" and pursuing higher and higher goals for weeks now&mdash;building up to her greatest victory every.

A victory that was impossible now.

She didn't know where she was, but she knew she failed. She would not be able to face Jack Noir, and that failure hurt her. But it was more than that. She orchestrated his rise, it didn't matter if it was fate or the will of paradox space or anything else, she was responsible.

She was responsible for the final death of her people. She was responsible slow death of her friends. Everything that went wrong with the session was solely on her shoulders.

And it hurt. Despite her entire culture revolving around killing, she hated what she had done.

And now she had to live with it.

John and Jade stand on the deck of the same ship, discussing their course of action.


<span class="jade">"I wouldn't really be alone. I have the population of five planets to keep me company!"</span>

Jade decaptchalouges the five planets and orbits them around her head like a miniature solar system to emphasize her point.

John takes in the majesty of the spectical and opens his mouth to respond.

<span class="vriska">"JOHN WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!!!"</span>

Vriska bursts onto the ships deck, plants her feet squarely and starts yelling at the two teens.

<span class="vriska">"First off, I have several questions on how you managed to t8ke me from the meteor onto wherever in paradox space we are. In addition, why would you t8ke me from the precipice of my gr8test triumph lastly&mdash;"</span>

John's confusion did little to stop his boundless optimism, <span class="john">"Hi Vriska, what are you doing here?"</span>

Vriska marches up to him, grabs the front of his shirt, and evenly stares into his eyes, <span class="john">"I don't know how, but a conspicuously taller version of you punched me in my f8ce and brought me here, while I was recovering. He turned us both into wind and th8n f8cked 8ff to who knows where. And now because of you I won't see my friends again because Jack is g8ing t8 f8nd th8m&mdash;"</span>

Her voice faded in and out of desperation as she returned to the place she was inside the ship. She shifted from anger to defeat back to anger again.

<span class="vriska">"And w8rst of all. Now I can't save them from Jack, a creature who ist <em>ent8rely</em> my fault!!!!!!!! So now I have to live the r8st of my m8sr8ble life knowing that 8ts <em>my</em> fault they're 8ll de8d!!!!!!!!</span>

<span class="jade">"Vriska,"</span> Jade interjected, <span class="jade"> "your friends are fine, and, as I was just telling John, I can act as a gateway to the green sun, where they are now. You can go back to them.</span>

The spell holding Vriska broke. She dropped her arm from John's shirt.

<span class="vriska">"I didn't kill them?"</span>

The anger was gone, all that was left was the small voice of a child who had made a series of terrible mistakes that cost her everything.

But she put the mask back on, <span class="vriska">"Good! I'd be disappointed in them if they died after all I did to help! And even if they did die, good riddance!!!!!!!! All that means is that they were weak!"</span>

John and Jade exchanged a look.

<span class="john">"Vriska,"</span> John spoke with all the kindness in the world, <span class="john">"do you want to go back to the meteor? To stay with your friends for the three years it'll take to reach the new session?"</span>

Vriska practically mumbled the next words, <span class="vriska">"I doubt any of them are still my friends after what I put them through. I can't go back and f8ce them, not until I fix this.</span>

<span class="john">"Fix what?"</span>

Vriska's temper flared again, <span class="vriska">"Jack, Tavros being dead, ruining our one chance of rem8king Alternia. I can't think of just one off the top of my head, so a list will have to do. God John, were you even p8ying attention while I was busy telling you my laundry-list of fuckups and world ending plans. Or am I just that unintresting to you that you forgot?"</span>

She glared at the two of them before turning around and striding back into the ship, <span class="vriska">"Now, I'm going to find a bedroom before you two numbskulls m8ke me want to pull my hair out."</span>

The brother and sister watched her back as it receded back in the ship.

John shook his head, <span class="vriska">"I know people are different online compared to the internet, but I'm worried about her. She isn't normally this erratic. Once she's calmed down I'm going to talk to her and see if I can help her."</span>

Jade snorts, <span class="jade">"I don't know why'd you bother. She just seems like a huge bitch to me."</span>

<span class="john">"Well its not like we can make her someone else's problem, considering she seems to not want to go back, so we'll need to make her tolrable to be around for the next three years."</span>

<span class="jade">"I mean we could always knock her out and captchlouge her."</span>

Jade burst into laughter at John's pointed glare at her, <span class="jade">"I'm kidding, I would never! Anyways, where were we?</span>

<span class="terezi">"SO WH4T YOU 4R3 T3LL1NG M3 D4V3 1S TH4T W3 BOTH H4V3 D34TH *4ND* COTTON C4NDY???"</span>

<span class="dave">"Hell yes."</span>

<span class="terezi">W3 M1GHT 4S W3LL B3 TH3 S4M3 D4MN SP3C13S!!! >:D"</span>

<span class="karkat">"ALL OF YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP,"</span> Karkat yelled before going on an explosive rant about <span style="color: #32cd32; -webkit-text-stroke: .5px black">the Green Sun</span>, Sollux being dead, Sollux being not dead, and Jack Noir. A rant that continued until a bucket appeared out of nowhere and beaned him on the head.

Completely silent for the first time in what seemed like weeks to everyone around him, he read the note that fell out of the bucket. His eyes glazed over at the phrase <span class="john">Troll/Human Sloppy Makeout Sessions</span> and he let the poster fall out of his hands.

He looked to Terezi and Dave, Rose and Kanaya, then back to the note on the floor. He inhaled slowly, and then:

<span class="karkat" style="word-wrap: break-word">"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"</span>

He preceded to flip the fuck out like he was a mastercraft chef making the mostly tasteful omelette in the universe and the fuck was said omelette in question.

The rest of them quietly pushed him into the corner and continued their strategy discussions.

It was a day later and John was looking for Vriska. He hadn't seen her since the day prior when they left their session and he was moderately worried.

He didn't think Vriska would be the type to self destruct after going through hardship, however there was so much he didn't know. He didn't know about how Trolls worked, he didn't know the details of what had happened to her, and he didn't know her all that well in general. He had spent one day getting to know her and had no idea whether her quiet absence from the group was utterly mundane, or dangerously abnormal.

Davesprite had bluntly told him that if he spent one more minute pacing trying to figure it out, he was going to have Jade lock him on LoHaC until he made up his mind. The threat of having to make a descision while battling perpetual godtier sustained cycle of death and rebirth via lava burns was enough to get him to go after her.
