Dave wasn't studying.

He had a exam in Biology the next day and he wasn't studying.

He had a *mid-term* in Biology the next day and he wasn't studying.

<span class="dave">"Fuck,"</span> he swore under his breath.

He stared at his laptop, then his phone, then back to his laptop. He repeated this process several more times before swearing and standing up.

<span class="dave">"John,"</span> he shouted as he pulled his jacket on, <span class="dave">"I'm gonna be back in a few hours!"</span>

John looked up from the preparations he was doing for *his* mid-term of the week, music theory.

<span class="john">"Uh, okay. Say hi to whoever you're meeting for me."</span>

<span class="dave">"How do you&mldr;whatever sure, man."</span>

Dave exited the darkened dorm into the too bright hallway, shades firmly already in place. His hands moved almost without thinking as he sent the text to his senior brother who lived off campus.

<span class="chat dave">TG: hey bro im headed over<br />TG: can you get out the bokken?</span>

His phone buzzed, but he already knew the reply without having to read it.

<span class="dirk chat">TT: Sure little man.<br />TT: I'm always happy to talk<br />TT: I'll meet you on the roof</span>

When Dave got to the apartment he was still frustrated.

He hated having to ask his brother for help, having to make himself a leech. He knew Dirk didn't think he was a leech, but that made him feel worse about having to do it.

He sighed as he buzzed himself into the building. It wasn't as if he had much choice.

These bizzare sparring matches/honest conversations between brothers always were the best thing to help him think. Well, maybe not think, but at the very least erode his uncertainties.

He got to the third floor and walked over to the ladder that led to the rooftop. He stared at it for a few seconds before ascending.

<span class="dirk">"Wassup Dave."</span>

Dirk was waiting for him. He wore his dumb shades and hat even in twilight, engrossed in some elaborate bit only he was aware of. The requested dual bokken rested on his shoulders like baseball bats.

<span class="dave">"Dude why the hell are you still wearing the shades. It's eight fucking thirty.</span>

Dirk's face broke out into a grin, <span class="dirk">"Bro its been a week since I've seen you and *that's* the first thing you say? The shades are rad as hell, and eyesight is overrated."</span>

Dave snorted and rolled his eyes.

<span class="dirk">"Laugh all you want, little bro, you know I'm right. Besides, I seem to recalled a certain someone doing the same thing."</span>

<span class="dave">"Yeah, because I was 14 and inexplicably thought you were cool. We doing this?"</span>

<span class="dirk">"Fuck yeah we are,"</span> he said as he swung the bokken in his right hand and arced it in the direction of Dave's hand.

Dave caught it effortlessly and the two began their duel.

---

From an outside perspective, the two were locked in a deadly dance. However each knew exactly what to do in order for nothing bad to happen.

They had a decade and a half of ill-advised practice. They knew where and how to strike to sting not break, to smack not crack, to make a loud and impression noise with the other's sword and not with the other's mouth as they cried out in pain.

The fact that it looked as deadly as it did was a testament to there bond.

However it was an illusion that was shattered the moment one of them opened their mouth.

<span class="dirk">"So what's bothering you?"</span> Dirk asked as he dodged backwards, away from a swipe to his midsection.

Dave was silent for a few moments, the air only being filled with the cracking sounds of wood on wood.

<span class="dave">"I'm not sure. I've been having trouble focusing on studying for my mid-terms, its really starting to frustrate me."</span>

<span class="dirk">"Dude you're a first-year. No one expects you be magically awesome at time-management and studying."</span>

Dave contemplatively stabbed Dirk's hat off, which Dirk managed to arrange so it landed back on his head.

<span class="dave">"I know&mdash; Maybe it's not that I'm frustrated that I can't study now, its that I used to be so much better at it in high school."</span>

Dirk batted Dave's sword away and said, <span class="dirk">"That's fair. But I'd ask myself if the two settings are really similar enough to warrant the comparison. The only commonality is you and me."</span>

<span class="dave">"But&mdash;"</span>

<span class="dirk">"It's true, Dave. The setting is completely different. We have to organize our own time now, as opposed to back in high school where our parents and teachers told us what to do and when. You gotta let go an accept that now that so much more is under your control than you're used to your productivity is gonna tank for a bit."</span>

Dave connected with Dirk's hilt and the bokken clattered to the floor in defeat.

<span class="dave">"You've destroyed me with facts and logic,"</span> Dave said wryly.

Dirk laughed as he picked up his sword, <span class="dirk">"Naw, it was a plea from the heart. And besides, I hoped to destroy your uncertainty, not you."</span>

Dave smiled at that, <span class="dave">"well I'm still hella uncertain, so I seem to have claimed victory there. But thanks Dirk. I think I get what you're saying."</span>

Dirk crossed over to Dave and put a hand on his shoulder, <span class="dirk">"I'm glad. It took me until halfway through my sophomore year to realize that expecting myself to be raring to go at all times was unrealistic, and I'm proud that I can help make that realization come a bit faster."</span>

<span class="dirk">"Now,"</span> Dirk ruffled Dave's hair, <span class="dirk">"want your bro to give you a little midterm tutoring?"</span>

Dave batted his hand away and smiled.

<span class="dave">"Yeah. I'd like that."</span>
