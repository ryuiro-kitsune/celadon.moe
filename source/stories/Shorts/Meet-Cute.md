David Elizabeth Strider had just fucked up.

He was in the midst of surviving his asinine workload over the weekend and had---after three hours of remaining motionless while taking notes for his History of Photography class---realized that his kettle finally had run out of water.

Dave stretched his arms and called out to his roommate, <span class="dave">"John?"</span>

He forgot, of course, that John had left to go on a date thirty minutes before.

<span class="dave">"Shit. I guess I better fucking get this shit done."</span>

He half-heartedly put on a button-up over his undershirt and briefly looked around the room for his pants, before realizing that, considering that he was staying in an all male dorm, the chances of anyone he'd be embaressed about seeing him in boxers seeing him was near zero.

Giving up on the pants, he grabbed the now empty kettle and started to go the drinking fountain in the hallway for the refill. He finished tugging his still unbuttoned shirt on and then threw open the door.

There was a girl there. A cute girl.

She appeared to be about his age, give or take a year, and was wearing a skirt and T-Shirt. Her long black hair fell to her mid-back and framed her face which was adorned with round glasses with thin frames.

The two stared at each other for what felt like an eternity before one of them broke the silence.

<span class="jade">"Hi. I'm Jade, John's sister,"</span> she said cheerfully as she stuck her hand out for a handshake.
