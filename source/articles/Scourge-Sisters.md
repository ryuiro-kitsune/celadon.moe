<div class="warning">
This is not *supposed* to be a comically incoherent rant about how two fictional characters shouldn't be shipped, however it is quickly looking to become that. Also seemingly just a rant about how Vriska was treated.

Read at your own digression

## Vriska is a bad person.

Let us take a quick moment to acknowledge that Vriska is a bad person.

She kills hundreds of people to feed her Lucus, builds a doomsday machine for a genocidal maniac, and most importantly, she the amount of characters she has maimed or killed in her friend group is almost equal to the number of trolls she interacted with before the start of Sgrub period.

That last one is most important for the thesis of this unhinged rant (VrisRezi is bad) for reasons that should be obvious --- TEREZI IS ONE OF THOSE FRIENDS SHE MAIMED.

</br>

Now, some may make and argument that because of her upbringing, these crimes can be forgiven, or at least put into context.

Now, there are many ways I could respond to that. Ranging from deliberately inflammatory (What're your thoughts on [insert human right violation here]), utterly dismissive (Who cares loser?), or how I actually feel.

I'm gonna go with the last one.

Yes, some of Vriska's actions can be explained by the context of her upbringing, specifically the first two. She is an upper class caste and that will warp your world-view, especially if the culture is overall geared towards violence. However, those crimes are more abstract, they merely serve as exposition for how bad Alternia is, the last and biggest issue with Vriska's past is wayyyyyyyy worse and worthy of scorn.

That's not just a human perspective, Vriska experiences a partial shunning from the other trolls for a while. Specifically after the murder of Aradia, the blinding of Terezi and the FORCING ARADIA'S FRIEND TO DEAL THE LETHAL BLOW. All of which was sparked by her disabling of the 4th member of her, Aradia, and Terezi's FLARPing troupe --- Tavros.

To the other trolls this is fucked up. So no "her society made her like that" can save her. Only self improvement and introspection can help her.

Also all of her past crimes working out to her friend's benefit. That also helped.

And to Vriska's credit, she does start down the road to self improvement with her meeting John and his relentless optimism gradually making her realize that living on Alternia fucking sucked and made her a bad person[^1] and she starts to transition into the first phase of her redemption arc.

[^1]: Yeah, not even Vriska will fully buy the "I did nothing wrong because it was the norm on Alternia thing.

And then Hussie shot her arc in the back.

## Everything is bad now

God I'm so sad on what happened to Vriska in act 6.

Every possible bad turn happened to her arc. She lost the thing that was helping her improve, she started a self indulgent quest, and then her last fucking interaction before DEUS EX SPIDERGIRL happens is her starting to date the worst and most selfish of the dead trolls, which is incredible back-sliding.

However, the worst fumble of this iteration is having her and Terezi get back together[^2]...

[^2]: Somewhat amusingly while a JohnxVriska ship songs plays in the background.

Yeah.

If you don't know why this is bad, let me phrase it another way.

Two people, who while they were dating ended up either failing to prevent the other from almost killing most of their friend group or being the one who almost killed half their friend group, get back together despite one of them blinding the other when she broke up with her.

Its bad, its so bad.

My sincere belief is that if Vriska is to end up dating someone it needs to either be: A) Not a troll, because of Alternia's negative impact on her causing her to do things she deeply regrets [See the end of Act 5 Act 2] or B) Literally anyone besides Aradia, Tavros, or Terezi, for obvious reasons.

## Deus Ex Spidergirl

So the retcon happened.

I'm not unhappy with it in concept. It follows Homestuck's long history of shrugging and doing whatever, that's how we got the trolls and, for better or worse, that's how we got the Cherubs. It's a metaphor for some literary studies concept I'm too much of a creative writing major to get.

However.

Terezi should not have brought back Vriska in that way. Not only does it make me feel hella icky for the standard SHE FUCKING BLINDED HER reasons, I also think that Tavros would have done just as well stopping Jade, who was the actual threat on the field.

However, my personal reasons Terezi shouldn't have thought to bring Vriska back aside, Vriska would've been useless on the meteor in regards to solving people's personal problems.

Think of it this way, she was, up until Act 5 Act 2, a bad person to have in the room when you wanted to bring people together and fix personal issues. That was never her role, she was a 8itchy wild-card who mostly acted rashly and fucked up shit. That's how she got to godtier, that's how she killed the king, and that's how she created Jack.

If you want a person to help people through their relationship issues, bring one of the voices of positivity back, so uh, Feferi, Nepeta? Possibly Tavros... Okay maybe there are less options than I thought, but Karkat plus Tavros plus Feferi could probably wrap up the drinking sub-plot, Gamzee being fucking awful, and everything else that came up in a month tops.

Sure that would be harder to do because they don't have one single moment that kills them that can be fixed but, hey, remember that Feferi Godtier ghost that revives Wayward Vagabond? THAT'S STILL A THING, THAT NEVER STOPPED BEING A THING, JUST USE YOUR ONE REVIVE THEY GET ON EACH OF THEM! JEGUS FUCKING CHRIST.

Or whatever, it doesn't have to be that. Just, it should have been Tavros or a troll good with people, not the one whose character development stopped at the end of cascade.

## Closer

I swear this was supposed to be about VrisRezi not Vriska.

She needs a quarantine thread for an article about her. smh

Honestly, I used to really love VrisRezi. I made the ship name my master password for my first password manager. I've just grown and realized that its honestly kind of messed up to have them get back together.

I promise this isn't some crazed JohnVris shipper making a rant post. Well, I do ship them, but mostly because he was the only character that had a positive impact on her in the whole comic and they got shafted.

Anyways, ship VrisRezi, don't ship VrisRezi. Just please don't be a dick in the comments.

<br />

OH ALSO, VRISKA IS CANONICALLY ATTRACTED TO NIC CAGE! I CAN'T BEILIVE I NEARLY FORGOT TO BRING THAT UP!
