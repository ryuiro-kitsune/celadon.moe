# Day Zero

I have often complained about my emacs config being clunky and useless in the terminal. Now I could do the rational thing and adapt my config to work properly in both tty and gui, however if I was one to do the rational thing, I wouldn't have been doing all of my school assignments in LaTeX for the past three years.

So I decided to try to maintain a neovim config. I'm doing this so I can stop bringing my large laptop everywhere and switch to my much smaller iPad (connecting to my laptop over ssh).

The Day Zero roadmap for this project --- which will be hosted on [github](https://github.com/ryuiro-kitsune/nvim-conf) --- is simple:

- Set up a system that can replace most of the functionality I use emacs for.
- Run in terminal flawlessly over ssh without gimping my proformence.

This is easier said than done due to several reasons, but this at least should guide my in the right direction.

More specifically, I'm worried about finding a way to edit and add to my [Org-Roam](https://www.orgroam.com/) database. This is the main method I am taking notes right now and it would be a travesty if this shift breaks my system. I'm hoping I can find a fix for this, even if its a merely write-only system, where I can take the notes in my class, but will need the full laptop to study them.

Well, thank you for reading this slightly rambling blog post, and I will see you again in [day one]()!
