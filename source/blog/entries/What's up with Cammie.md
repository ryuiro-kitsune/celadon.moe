Howdy!

I wanted to do a little bloggy update on what I’ve been up to.

Mostly its been reading comics.

I've recently gotten into&mdash;and subsequently binged&mdash;the webcomics by <a href="https://twitter.com/damnyouwillis">David Willis</a>, <a href="https://www.dumbingofage.com/">Dumbing of Age</a> and <a href="http://www.itswalky.com/comic/and-now/">the plethora of Walkyverse comics</a>.

If y'all're hungering for slice of life college action, I'd recommend checking out Dumbing of Age. It's Walky and co are harder for me to recommend because they're 26 years old at this point, but if you're into Sci-Fi and super-heros, they might be worth a look.

Well, I say they're hard to recommend as if I didn't snap up all the books I could get my hands on.

Aside from webcomics, I've also been reading the Haruhi Suzumiya series. I'm not sure what to think of it so far, the humor feels a bit dry to me. If have a more intense opinion on it, I'll update in that weeks blog post.

Finally, I've been knitting a scarf.

The timing of it isn't perfect, as we're moving into summer right now, but its a nice and relaxing activity.

Thank you for your time. :)
