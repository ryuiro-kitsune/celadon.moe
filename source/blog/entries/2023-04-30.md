So...

I said I was gonna have something special on Sunday. That was supposed to be a blog post, collegestuck update, and a little extra-canonical collegestuck story. 

But, I got sick and that killed my momentum. Because of this, I'm rescheduling things.

For sake of transparency, I'm going to give the rough idea of when these will go up.

The collegestuck update will go up tomorrow during the normal update schedule for the series. This is replacing the planned blog post. Finally, the extra-canonical side story will go up on Friday alongside the last update of this little mini-arc.

Sorry for the light week, I'll try to get well soon.

Ta-ta for now. :)
