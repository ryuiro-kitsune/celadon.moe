So, I've been busy with school.

Some of you may know I am a first year college student. Because of this and the fact that it is currently finals season, I'm having to ramp down my writing until it blows over.

"But Cel," I hear you say, "isn't writing a good way to destress from finals? It would be a good idea to keep writing at least a little bit."

Yeah, that's fair. But unfortunately, one of my finals is actually writing the final draft of a short story for my creative writing class, so I'm running my writing engines on maximum as it stands.

I'm prepping to get *something* out this Sunday, so I will see you all then.
