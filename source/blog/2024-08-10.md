title: Digi-shrine is now (technically) online!
---
So for those who didn't know, I've been a practicing Pagan since I was 4. It's a more minor part of my identity so I don't bring it up often.

One of my goals with this site was to have a page that acts af a digital recreation of the shrine I usually have set up for the Sabbats in my dorm room.

It's still pretty basic right now, only saying that I'm preparing for the next closest holiday, but is technically up right [here](/shrine/)!

Stay tuned for updates!
