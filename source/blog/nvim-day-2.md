# Day One

My goal for today is to get a package manager installed. In Emacs I use straight.el but in Neovim I decided to go with [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) because it says in the repo that it was inspired by use-package, which is the front-end package installation macro for emacs. I'd be lying if I said I understood what I was doing, but after copying enough snippets from the repo, I was able to get both packer and Org Mode installed.

Oh yeah, Org Mode, apparently someone ported all of Org Mode into neovim, so my goal of being able to take notes in class is looking up.

In a few days., I'm going to start playing with this new Org Mode and get a file browser installed. For now, I'm gonna put this project on the back burner in favor of just vibing in emacs.
